## 3. Cloud Provider Selection and Justification (Updated to Oct 26, 2025)

### 3.1 Cloud Provider Comparison

We re-evaluated the three major cloud providers with up-to-date footprint and pricing references.

#### 3.1.1 Amazon Web Services (AWS) — updated facts

**Strengths:**
- Largest market share and very mature ecosystem
- Extensive global infrastructure: 120 Availability Zones across 38 Geographic Regions (publicly documented). 
- Comprehensive service portfolio (200+ services)
- Strong third-party integration ecosystem

**Representative Pricing (US East / public on-demand examples, Oct 2025):**
- Compute (t3.xlarge, 4 vCPU / 16 GiB): ~$0.1664 / hour (on-demand typical listing). 
- Storage (S3 Standard): Tiered; about $0.023 / GB / month for the first tier (US East example), subject to tier thresholds. 
- Database (RDS MySQL comparable): pricing varies by instance class; example comparable monthly figures remain in line with prior estimates (~$120–$150/month for moderate DB instances depending on spec). (See provider pricing pages.)
- Reserved / Savings Options: Reserved instances and Savings Plans still provide the most significant discounts (standard RIs and Savings Plans can reduce costs significantly — up to ~72–75% depending on plan and term). 

#### 3.1.2 Google Cloud Platform (GCP) — updated facts

**Strengths:**
- Strong analytics, data processing, and AI/ML tooling
- Competitive compute pricing and sustained-use discounts

**Representative Pricing (US Central / Oct 2025):**
- Compute (e2-standard-4, 4 vCPU / 16 GiB): typical published range clusters around $0.13–$0.16 / hour (region and sustained use affect final). 
- Storage (Cloud Storage Standard): roughly $0.02–$0.023 / GB / month depending on region and tier. (See GCP location pricing.)
- Discount Model: Sustained use discounts and committed use discounts can reduce long-running VM costs substantially.

#### 3.1.3 Microsoft Azure — updated facts (selected provider)

**Strengths:**
- Seamless integration with Microsoft ecosystem (Office 365, Teams, Active Directory, Dynamics)
- Strong hybrid cloud and edge options
- Broad enterprise compliance portfolio and retail integrations

**Representative Pricing (East US / Oct 2025):**
- Compute (B4ms, 4 vCPU / 16 GiB): ~$0.166 / hour (on-demand listed examples show approximately this value). 
- Storage (Blob Storage): pricing depends on tier (Hot/Cool/Archive) and capacity; common hot-tier public examples are variable but competitive — Azure marketing shows 70+ regions and 400+ datacenters, and Blob pricing can be in the same ballpark or better depending on tier and commitment. (See Azure pricing pages for accurate per-tier numbers.) 
- Database (Azure SQL Database): managed tiers remain competitively priced; examples for moderate workloads align with prior monthly estimates depending on performance tier.
- Reserved / Commitment Discounts: Azure Reserved VM Instances advertise savings up to 72% off pay-as-you-go for 1–3 year commitments (and higher combined savings with Azure Hybrid Benefit). 

### 3.2 Provider Selection: Microsoft Azure (updated rationale)

**Why Azure (updated to Oct 26, 2025):**

#### 3.2.1 Business Integration Advantages
- **Microsoft Ecosystem**: many enterprises use Microsoft productivity tools (Office 365, Teams), easing identity and workflow integration.
- **Dynamics 365 Commerce**: still a purpose-built retail/commerce platform with ongoing 2025 release wave updates for omnichannel retail features. 
- **Azure Active Directory / M365 integration**: seamless identity and access management across cloud resources.

#### 3.2.2 Cost Optimization Benefits
- **Storage / commitment options**: per-GB costs depend on tier and committed capacity; Azure continues to offer reserved capacity and up to ~72% savings on VM reservations. 

#### 3.2.3 Retail-Specific Advantages
- **Dynamics 365 Commerce**: API-first, omnichannel focus and ongoing feature deliveries in 2025 release waves. 
- **Azure AI / Cognitive services**: Azure rebranded and consolidated AI offerings (Azure AI services, formerly called Cognitive Services) with prebuilt models and integration into Fabric/Azure stacks. 

#### 3.2.4 Technical Considerations
- **Hybrid & edge**: Azure remains strong at hybrid scenarios — useful for multi-store deployments and edge POS systems.
- **Global footprint**: Microsoft advertises 70+ Azure regions and hundreds of datacenters (largest region count among hyperscalers as of Oct 2025). 

### 3.3 Cost Comparison Summary (updated figures)

| Service | AWS (example) | Azure (example) | GCP (example) | Selected |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| Compute (4 vCPU, 16GB) | t3.xlarge ≈ $0.1664/hr (US East typical on-demand). | B4ms ≈ $0.166/hr (East US typical). | e2-standard-4 ≈ $0.13–$0.16/hr (region & sustained-use dependent). | Azure (selected for integration) |
| Storage (per GB/month) | S3 Standard ≈ $0.023/GB (first-tier). | Blob (hot/cool tiers variable — competitive with $0.018–0.03+/GB depending on tier/commit). | Cloud Storage ≈ $0.02–$0.023/GB (standard tier). | Azure ✓ |
| Database | RDS / managed DB (varies) | Azure SQL (managed tiers) | Cloud SQL (managed tiers) | Azure* |
| Reserved Discounts | Up to ~72–75% with RIs/Savings Plans (depending on plan). | Up to 72% (Azure Reserved VM Instances); up to ~80% combined with Azure Hybrid Benefit in some scenarios. | Committed Use Discounts / Sustained Use (varies) | Azure* |

*Selected for integration benefits despite comparable compute pricing; all three providers offer meaningful discounts with committed usage.

**Total Estimated Monthly Cost for FashionGroup (Medium Scale, illustrative):**
- **AWS**: ~$15,000 / month (illustrative)
- **Azure**: ~$16,200 / month (+~8% premium for integration benefits)
- **GCP**: ~$15,500 / month (illustrative)

**ROI Justification**: The integration & productivity benefits of Azure (reduced integration costs, faster time-to-market, staff familiarity, and enterprise support) continue to justify the modest premium in many enterprise retail scenarios. (See reservation and integration references above.)
